# Personal Galery
is my highschool project created in 2015.
It provides cloud storage for user's pictures. Users can organized their pictures into albums aka folders.

You can see it working right there http://www.beetroot.g6.cz/registrace.php
Please do not use it for it's purpose due to limited storage and network traffic. 
You can also read the story of this project in the attached PDF file (in czech only).
